##Project Overview, Challenges, and Goals: 
For my project four, I had to overcome choosing an idea and running with it. I initially wanted to implement React on Rails but decided upon it, and that it was way out of my comfort zone. I decided a later that I was just going to go full out on Ruby on Rails. I did not scaffold, but I did start from the bottom up getting my CRUD functionality going.
